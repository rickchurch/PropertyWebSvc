The pictures that are saved to the LegacyPics folder have the following naming convention;

../images/LegacyPics/<width in pixals>_<height in pixals>__fileName.jpg  (or could be a different extension)

example;     images/LegacyPics/430_573__Vacant_227_LR.jpg

the reason for this is because some pics may be more tall than wide (the case with the pics first copied here) 
   and so this naming convention allows
   the code to adjust the width and height accordingly.  The more common pic format is probably the landscape
   view where the width is more than the height.
